# LES Model Calibration Project

This repository contains all the code and data for a project aimed at calibrating Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) with Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). The project seeks to improve the accuracy of LES models in predicting complex fluid flow behaviors by tuning model parameters through Bayesian calibration methods.

## Project Overview

Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a widely used computational technique in fluid dynamics to simulate turbulent flows by resolving large-scale structures while modeling smaller scales. However, LES models often require careful calibration to provide accurate results for specific applications. This project uses Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) with MCMC sampling to calibrate key parameters of LES models, leveraging true data for validation.

### Data Source

The true data for this project is sourced from the **[Johns Hopkins Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) Turbulence Database](https://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/)** . This dataset provides high-fidelity turbulence data, which is used to validate and benchmark the calibrated LES model.

## Repository Structure

- **Code**: All Python code for the calibration process, simulation setup, and data handling is organized in scripts and functions.
- **Data**: Experimental and simulated data used for calibration and validation, including both raw data files and processed datasets.
